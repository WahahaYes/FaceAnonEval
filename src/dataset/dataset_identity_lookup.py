"""
File: dataset_identity_lookup.py

This file defines the abstract base class DatasetIdentityLookup,
providing an interface for looking up identities in a dataset.
It utilizes the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module to define an abstract
method that must be implemented by concrete subclasses.

Libraries and Modules:
- ABC (from abc): Provides infrastructure for defining Abstract Base Classes.

Usage:
- Inherit from the DatasetIdentityLookup class when creating a dataset-specific identity lookup class.
- Implement the abstract method `lookup`, which defines the mechanism to look up the identity corresponding to an image file.
- The abstract class enforces that any concrete subclasses must provide an implementation for the `lookup` method.
 
Attributes:
- None

Methods:
- __init__(self): Initializes the DatasetIdentityLookup object. This is a placeholder method with no specific functionality.
- lookup(self, file_path: str): Abstract method that needs to be implemented by concrete subclasses. It specifies the mechanism to look up the identity associated with an image file.

Note:
- This abstract base class is designed to be inherited by classes that handle identityu lookup tasks in specific datasets.
- The `abstractmethod` decorator indicates that any concrete subclass must implement the `lookup` method, ensuring consistency across different identity lookup implementations.
