## Introduction

Privacy concerns related to facial recognition have become a critical aspect of research and development. This framework aims to address these concerns by providing a set of tools for anonymizing facial recognition datasets. It also includes evaluation methodologies to assess the performance of facial recognition systems while maintaining privacy.

## Features

- Anonymization Mechanisms: 
   - [dcos_metric_privacy](src/privacy_mechanisms/dcos_metric_privacy.py): A mechanism for Differential Coefficient of Sensitivity (DCoS) Metric Privacy.
   - [detect_face_mechanism](src/privacy_mechanisms/detect_face_mechanism.py): A mechanism for detecting and anonymizing faces.
   - [gaussian_blur](src/privacy_mechanisms/gaussian_blur.py): Applies Gaussian blur to anonymize facial features.
   - [identity_dp](src/privacy_mechanisms/identity_dp.py): Implements Identity Differential Privacy (IDP) for privacy preservation.
   - [metric_privacy](src/privacy_mechanisms/metric_privacy.py): Implements various metric privacy techniques.
   - [pixel_dp](src/privacy_mechanisms/pixel_dp.py): Applies Pixel Differential Privacy (PixelDP) to images.
   - [simple_mustache](src/privacy_mechanisms/simple_mustache.py): Adds a simple mustache overlay to anonymize faces.
   - [simswap](src/privacy_mechanisms/simswap.py): Applies face swapping for privacy preservation.

- Evaluation Methodologies: 
   - [emotion_utility](src/evaluation/emotion_utility.py): Evaluates the utility of anonymized datasets based on emotion recognition.
   - [lfw_validation](src/evaluation/lfw_validation.py): Evaluates anonymized datasets using the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.
   - [rank_k](src/evaluation/rank_k.py): Evaluates anonymized datasets using a rank-k evaluation method.
   - [validation_evaluation](src/evaluation/validation_evaluation.py): Performs validation evaluation of anonymized datasets.

- Customizable: Easily extendable with new privacy mechanisms and evaluation methodologies
- Batch Processing: Efficiently processes datasets in batches for scalability
- Detailed Documentation: Comprehensive documentation for each module and functionality
- Open Source: Released under an open-source license for collaboration and contributions

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Additional requirements are specified in `requirements.txt`.
- Download the CelebA dataset (https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and place at 'Datasets/CelebA/'.
- Download the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset (https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) and place at 'Datasets/lfw' (we use the unaligned images, as our codebase performs face detection/ alignment).
- While we evaluate on CelebA and lfw, some evaluation methodologies will accept any identity-labeled dataset.  See [Customization](#customization) for more details.

## Installation

Install requirements with:
pip install -r requirements.txt

By default, the requirements are configured to support CUDA-enabled GPUs.  If running on CPU, run the following commands after installing requirements:
pip uninstall onnxruntime-gpu
pip install onnxruntime

We additionally provide a Dockerfile and docker-config.yaml to automatically create an environment.  To create an image and open a terminal within:
docker-compose run --rm faceanoneval

If on Windows, to have full terminal functionality:
winpty docker-compose run --rm faceanoneval
A CPU or GPU targeted image can be specified in the 'docker-compose.yaml' file.

## Usage

### Processing a Dataset

To process a dataset with a specific privacy mechanism, use the following command:
python process_dataset.py --dataset <dataset_name> --privacy_mechanism <mechanism_name>

### Evaluating Anonymized Datasets

To evaluate an anonymized dataset using a specific evaluation methodology, use the following command:
python evaluate_mechanism.py --dataset <dataset_name> --privacy_mechanism <mechanism_name> --evaluation_method <method_name>

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute, please follow these guidelines:
- Follow coding standards and conventions used in the project.
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Before submitting a pull request, ensure all tests pass and add relevant tests if necessary.

## FAQ

- **Q:** How do I install the framework?
  - **A:** Please refer to the [Installation](#installation) section for detailed instructions on installing the framework and its dependencies

.

- **Q:** What datasets are supported for evaluation?
  - **A:** While we primarily evaluate on CelebA and LFW datasets, some evaluation methodologies accept any identity-labeled dataset. See [Customization](#customization) for more details.

## Installation Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please try the following troubleshooting steps:
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- If using a GPU, make sure the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN are properly configured.
- If running into compatibility issues, check for updates or patches for the dependencies.

## Integration with CI/CD

The framework can be integrated into continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment. Detailed instructions for integration with popular CI/CD tools will be provided in the documentation soon.

## Performance Metrics

Performance metrics and benchmarks for the privacy mechanisms and evaluation methodologies will be included in future releases to help users understand their effectiveness and performance characteristics in different scenarios.
